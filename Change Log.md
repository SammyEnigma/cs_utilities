Changes From 1.0 to 1.1
-----------------------

Removed the FTP-related code from the Utilities.Internet project (specifically the Ftp.cs and FtpListEntry.cs files).  As a replacment, there's a great project on CodePlex called [System.Net.FtpClient](http://netftp.codeplex.com/).

Removed Utilities.Core/CommandLine.cs and related unit tests.  For a better command line library, try [Command Line Parser Library](https://commandline.codeplex.com/) on CodePlex.
